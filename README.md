# Tic Tac Toe Web Application

This project is a simple, single-page Tic Tac Toe web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The background color of the game board is red. This project aims to demonstrate a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

## Setup

To run this project locally, simply download all the files in this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

To play the Tic Tac Toe game, simply click on the squares of the game board to place your X or O. The game will automatically switch turns between players. The first player to get three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If all squares on the board are filled and there is no winner, the game will end in a draw.

## Code Explanation

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the game board and the necessary elements for the game to function.

The CSS file (`style.css`) is used to style the game board, setting the background color to red and styling the X and O symbols.

The JavaScript file (`app.js`) is responsible for handling the game logic, including checking for a winner, switching turns between players, and ending the game in a draw if necessary.
